<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  Grandiosa is an application to set up and control other applications running through
  <a href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a>. Grandiosa has four central configurable entities:
  application groups, applications, application instances and load balancers. All entities are persisted in a database.
</p>

<p>
  An application group is a way to organise applications. Applications can be organised according to company
  departments, or in all other desirable
  ways.
</p>

<p>
  An application may have several application instances, which HAProxy can set up in a loadbalanced mode (balance
  between instances) and/or in a failover mode (use one or more instances as primary
  instances, and one or more instances as backup instances). An application instance is used to point to a server
  hosting the application.
</p>

<p>
  A load balancer in Grandiosa is an entity representing a configuration for an HAProxy instance. A load balancer can be
  associated with several applications, and an application can be set up
  in several load balancers.
</p>

<br/>

<h2>Setting up</h2>

<p>
  To make a useful configuration for a load balancer, at least one of each entity must be set up. All entities can be
  configured on the front page. At the top of the page application groups,
  applications and application instances are configured, while new load balancers are set up at the bottom of the page.
</p>

<p>
  Application groups must be given a name and a port. The port is the port HAProxy listens to when routing traffic to
  the applications belonging to the group.
</p>

<h3>New application</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Public path</strong> is the path which will forward traffic to this application.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Private path</strong> is the path where the application instances are running, and to which the load
    balancer should route the traffic. The load balancer will replace the public path
    with the private path in its configuration to manage the routing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Check path</strong> should point to a page in the application, and is used by the load balancer to check if
    the application instances for this application are running. The
    applications may control this page themselves, and set the HTTP status code to something other than 2xx or 3xx to
    indicate that the server has some issues and should be set to DOWN by the load
    balancer.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Emails</strong> are sent to all configured addresses for the application, when the status (UP/DOWN/MAINT)
    of an application instance changes.
  </li>
</ul>

<br/><br/>

<h3>Application instances</h3>

<img src="/web/images/app-instances.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br/><br/>

<p>
  Application instances must be set up for each application. The instances must be given a name and a server address
  (host:port) indicating where the instances should be running. Each instance
  can be set up as primary or backup. The load balancer will do load balancing between the primary instances, and use
  one of the backup instances if all primary instances are down or under
  maintenance. The application can be set up to use sticky sessions or not. Sticky sessions ensures that a user will
  come to the same application instance each time, as long as the instance is up
  and the cookie exists.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Sticky</dt>
  <dd>will insert a prefix into a cookie named JSESSIONID.</dd>

  <dt>Sticky New Cookie</dt>
  <dd>will create a new cookie</dd>
</dl>

<p>
  When setting up a new load balancer entity, it must point to a host machine where HAProxy is installed. It must be
  given a unique name and an absolute path to an existing working directory on
  the host machine, where Grandiosa will put a configuration file for the load balancer, a pid-file with the process id
  of the running load balancer process, and scripts to start and stop the load
  balancer. A username to a user on the host machine, and the private part of an SSH key pair, matching the public part
  in 'authorized_keys' for that user, must be given, to allow Grandiosa to
  control the load balancer on that machine.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Timeouts</dt>
  <dd>
    Different timeouts can also be set. The check timeout tells the load balancer how long it should wait when it's
    checking if an instance is up. The server timeout tells the load balancer how long
    it should wait for application instances to respond to requests. The client timeout tells the load balancer how long
    it should wait for clients to acknowledge or send data, if they are expected
    to do so. The connect timeout sets the maximum time to wait for a connection attempt to an application instance to
    succeed. Retries sets the number of retries to perform on an application
    instance after a connection failure. Since the load balancer is set to continuously check if the instances are up
    and set them to DOWN if the check is unsuccessful, the connect timeout and
    number of retries isn't that useful.
  </dd>

<h2>Routing to specific instances based on header rules</h2>

<p>
  Each application can be set up with a set of rules to route specific users to a specific set of instances. This can be
  used to allow a selected set of users to test a new application version.
  The way to accomplish this is to create a new application entity with the instances to test, and add rules to this
  application entity. The rules must be set up to test if the values of specified
  HTTP header fields match an entered regular expression. Rules for an application is set up by clicking this button:

</p>

<img src="/web/images/header_rules.png" class="img-thumbnail"><br/><br/>

<p>
  In the example above, users with a header 'iv-user'=1234 will be sent to Finch-Systemtest, users with 'iv-user'
  beginning with 0 will be sent to Finch-Kundetest and all others will be sent to
  Finch-Prod. Since rules may overlap, the order of the applications matters. The first rules to match will be used. In
  the example, if Finch-Prod had been at the top, it would take all the
  traffic, not considering the other rules. The order of the applications under an application group, can be set by
  drag-and-drop.
